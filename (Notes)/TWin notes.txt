--- Layout algorithm

* Data each view needs:
  * Cached size/stretch/shrink
  * Hard sizes

* Upon any significant change (attributes changed, subviews changed):
  * Recompute my preferred sizes based on my subviews' size
  * If I'm the window content view:
    * Tell myself to perform physical layout
    * Resize window to fit me
  * Else:
    * Tell superview I've changed

* physical layout:
  * Size myself according to the computed preferred size
  * Resize my subviews according to my actual size
  * Tell each subview to do the same
