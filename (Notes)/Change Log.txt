  - Scroll Lock is handled by MWOutputTextView.
2002-03-11 kpreid

  - CGMud plugin uses this system.
2002-03-10 kpreid
  - Added 'recent documents' category to library.
  * New private release for Bruce.

  - -[MWAppDelegate pathForResourceFromSearchPath:] refuses to return paths for dot files, including '../'.
2002-02-28 kpreid
  - Subclassed NSApplication to provide a termination hook called *before* documents are saved. This will allow the provision of guaranteed confirmation of connection window closing.
  - Added relevant methods to MWOutputWinController.
  - Moved the code for creating a chain of filters from MWDocument to +[MWLink buildFilterChain:configuration:].
  - Hopefully fixed bug where global input window's undo manager would become inconsistent due to history selection.

  - MCP package dns-com-awns-rehash implemented.
  - MWDocumentSettings no longer writes some keys in saved documents as archived objects.
  - GUI output window no longer has the extra status bar, and the custom-area view is the same as the window content view. This has revealed some bugs/quirks in the CGMud implementation.
2002-02-22 kpreid
  - Document settings object is now a subclass of NSMutableDictionary. Default settings are kept in a global dictionary and faked into the individual document settngs.
  - Output window controllers use the default settings object if they have no document.
  - Python console working.
  - Library window uses an outline.
  - Automatic reconfiguration: filters watch for changes to the document settings and reconfigure themselves.
2002-02-19 kpreid
  - Trying to make a 'console' for the Python interpreter. Figured out that the problem is that MWTextOutputWinController can't handle not being associated with a document.
  - Solving that problem.
2002-02-18 kpreid
  - Creating MWInputClient protocol in framework to allow plugins' windows to use the global input window and to separate the concepts of 'output window controller' vs 'uses global input window'.

2002-02-13 kpreid
  - Moved framework into a separate project to enforce proper header separation.
  - Removed all GUI commands.

  - Output windows' titles indicate if they are unlinked.
  - OneLineRequest windows close if unlinked.
  - Scrollback line limit implemented.
  - Tab key should toggle between input panel and output window.
  - XML plist documents are almost useless since they can't directly store NSColor, NSFont, or NSURL. Going back to NSArchiver.
  * Uploaded copy to web site, told Donna@Hesperian about it.
2002-02-10 kpreid
  - MSP implementation looks in search path for sounds.
