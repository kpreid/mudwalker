In the original version of this, the various tag types *were* the enum
types, but in many places I *want* them to occupy only 1 byte of
storage. There is no portable way to do this in C. Sigh. So, I've made
them all 'unsigned char', and rely on the fact that the original
language protected me against enum member misuse, so the only problems
will be those that I make after this conversion to C.
