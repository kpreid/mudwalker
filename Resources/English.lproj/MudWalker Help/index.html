<h1>MudWalker Help</h1>

<p>There isn't much here. My excuse: I don't know what documentation would be <em>useful</em>, rather than simply clutter that restates the obvious.</p>

<p>So: the only information you'll find here is what I've written because I either felt it specifically needed documenting or was requested. If there is something you need help with, or feel needs further documentation, feel free to ask on the <a href="http://mudwalker.cubik.org/">MudWalker mailing list</a>, or contact me by one of the methods listed on my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kpreid/#contact">web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Reference</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="ref/menus.html">Menu Bar</a>
  <li><a href="ref/keybindings.html">Keyboard Commands</a>
  <li><a href="ref/config.html">Configuration</a>
  <li><a href="script/index.html">Scripting</a>
</ul>  

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Logs of all sessions are automatically saved into <code>Library/Logs/MudWalker Log <var>document-name</var>.txt</code>. This is not configurable.</li>
  <li>The "Expert Editor" settings pane doesn't actually allow editing anything.</li>
  <li>The "Key Macros" settings pane does not provide a nice way to specify keystrokes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation Note</h2>

<p>Connection documents are saved as serialized objects using <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/Classes/NSArchiver.html">NSArchiver</a>. This means, for example, you can read a document using <a href="http://www.fscript.org">F-Script</a> and examine or modify it.</p>
